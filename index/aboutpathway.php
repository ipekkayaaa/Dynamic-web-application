        <h1>What is Pathway?</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;Pathways is UL Lafayette's new platform for students to improve their research skills. Students can register for Pathways
            and attend to the co-curriculum activityes in their department. These activities are created for studnets who are interested in 
            increasing research skills. Students will earn certificate when they complate the activities. <br>
            <br>&nbsp;
            Studnets must register the pathway in their department. Each department has 2 different pathways; Distingush and Exellence pathways.
            Students can choose one of these two pathway in their department. Exellence pathway requires more activities than Distingush pathway. 
            However each pathway will help stundets to gain new research skills and earn certificate. </p>
